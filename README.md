# Todo App

This is a simple react app which allows a user to add their todo. Talking about the technologies involved in creating this application are listed below:

1. React JS
2. Material Tailwind
3. Redux Toolkit (maintaining client side states of the application)
4. React Query (handling server side states of the application)
5. Formik with Yup (for handling and validating forms)
6. Nanoid (to generate random uid)
7. Framer Motion (for implementing animations to the application)
8. JSON server (for providing a local backend for the applicaton)

To run the application locally, you need to follow the following steps:

- Clone the project to your local machine by using the command `git clone`.
- After the project is cloned to the machine, you need to install the dependencies by using the command `npm install`.
- Run the command `npx run server` which will setup a JSON server for the application.
- Now, open another terminal in the same project directory and run the command `npm run dev` to start the application.
